# KDD-CUP-Project
The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good'' normal connections

# What is the KDD:
KDD is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge discovery in databases it’s called a (KDD) 
competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data 
Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners.
# What type of services KDD provides:
KDD is used especially for machine learning ‘ML’, deep learning ‘DL’, databases, pattern 
matching and artificial intelligence ‘AI’
# Why it is important to study KDD process:
The main objective of the KDD process is to extract information from data in the context of 
large databases. It does this by using Data Mining algorithms to identify what is deemed 
knowledge. The Knowledge Discovery in Databases is considered as a programmed, 
exploratory analysis and modelling of vast data repositories.
# Summarized
This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 
Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International 
Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a 
network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' 
connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database 
contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions 
simulated in a military network environment.
# KDD and what is content:
KDD Cup 99 dataset The KDD Cup 99 dataset is one of the most widely used training sets; it 
is based on the DARPA 1998 dataset. This dataset contains 4,900,000 replicated attacks on 
record. 
# What is the DARPA dataset:
DARPA is a dataset consisting of communications between source IPs and destination IPs. 
This dataset contains different attacks between IPs.

# Attack Type: 
There is one type of the normal type with the identity of normal and 22 attack types, which 
are divided into five major categories: 
• DoS (Denial of Service attacks)
• R2L (Root to Local attacks)
• U2R (User to Root attack), 
• Probe (Probing attacks) 
• Normal. 
For each record, the KDD Cup 99 training dataset contains 41 fixed feature attributes and a 
class identifier. 
Of the 41 fixed feature attributes.
A- Symbolic type, seven characteristic properties:
B- Continuous type for the rest.
In addition, the features include:
• Basic features (No.1–No.10)
• Content features (No.11–No.22)
• Traffic features (No.23–No.41)
DoS (Denial of Service attacks)
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack 
meant to shut down a machine or network, 
making it inaccessible to its intended users. 
DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash.
Ex: Teardrop attack
R2L (Root to Local attacks):
Remote to user (R2L) is one type of computer 
network attacks, in which an intruder sends set of 
packets to another computer or server over a 
network where he/she does not have permission to 
access as a local user.
Ex: Guessing_Passwd attack

U2R (User to Root attack):
User-to-Root (U2R) attacks have the objective of a non-privileged user acquiring root or 
admin-user access on a specific computer or a system on which the intruder had userlevel access. Remote-to-Local (R2L) attacks involve sending packets to the victim 
machine.
Ex: Various “ Buffer_overflow attack”
Probe (Probing attacks):
Probing attacks are an invasive method for 
bypassing security measures by observing the 
physical silicon implementation of a chip. As an 
invasive attack, one directly accesses the internal 
wires and connections of a targeted device and 
extracts sensitive information.
Ex: Port canning attack
